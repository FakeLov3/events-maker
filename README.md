## About the App

Due to the changing in the world post Covid we need to make changes in the way we used to live,
attending to big events and conferences will not be a reality for a long time, so we came up with this idea to bring the user experince a little bit closer when attending a big event. 

Our challenge consist in creating a tool to help people, jornalists and speechers to connect and interact in an easier way improving the experience and creating engagement when in a live event. 

After the brainstorming process our next step was to "feel" and to know why real people don't use the chat of live events and the answer was in most cases the lack of organization. 

So our focus was to develop a categorized chat created by the event owner allowing people to choose wich room / channel he want to be part of and switch between those channels while the event are happening. 

## Our mission

Our mission is to facilitate the interaction between the parts of a online event after the Pandemic, bringing the real world experience to the online world, changing and improving at the same time the way the people connect, communicate and feel about an online event from the confort of their houses.
